# Using Siamese neural networks to create a simple rhyme detection system

This repo contains the code which accompanies [my blog post](https://paulminogue.com/index.php/2021/02/14/using-a-siamese-neural-network-to-create-a-simple-rhyme-detector/) on rhyme detection using Siamese neural networks.

Feel free to use the code in this repo as a template for your own modelling or analysis!
